x   -   Install CyberDuck or other SFTP client application on your own local development system.
x   -   Install Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin and activate.
x   -   Add code to your custom child theme's functions.php file, including a new PHP function that registers one or more custom  post types of your choosing.
x   -   Use ACF to define at least one field group and associate it with one of your custom post types.
x   -   Create multiple new posts with content for one of your custom post types.
x   -   Add code to your custom child theme's functions.php file, including a new PHP function that contains a custom SQL query that uses a JOIN to combine columns from two tables — wp_posts and wp_postmeta — in the results returned to a new REST endpoint URL.
x   -   Test the new endpoint by loading the REST endpoint URL in your browser and verify valid JSON-formatted data is returned.
x   -   Make a clone of your Next.js-powered app from Week 12: Assignment 12: Basic Headless CMS-Powered App.
x   -   Edit the code in your project's lib/data.js file to use the Node GOT module to retrieve the JSON data from your WordPress REST API endpoint. (Instead of loading local JSON file via FS module.) You will need to change code in each function found in lib/data.js, including: getAllIds(), getSortedList(), and getData().
x   -   Ensure that the home page (generated by pages/index.js) and dynamic routing page (generated by pages/[id].js) of your app renders content from the JSON data delivered from the custom WordPress REST API endpoint you created.
x   -   Create a new GitHub repository and commit the code changes from your development workspace to your GitHub repository, using the CLI git command.
x   -   Use your Vercel account to deploy your new project to Vercel.
x   -   Copy the PHP code in your child theme's functions.php file and paste into your response to question #1.
x   -   Copy the GitHub link for your repository. Enter the repository link URL in response to question #2.
X   -   Copy the Vercel preview URL for your new project deployment. Enter the Vercel preview link URL in response to question #3.
